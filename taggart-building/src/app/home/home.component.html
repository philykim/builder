        <p>"I recently had work done by Taggart building and remodel to redo my bathrooms and they have exceeded my expectations in the work they did. When Nelson came out he was so well detail oriented and may I say he really knows his stuff. I went into this with an idea of how I wanted these bathrooms to come out and he did exactly that and some. 10/10 I would definitely recommend for any remodel work needed."</p>
